Determine Classes:
What are good candidates for classes in this program?
    -program.cs
    -EntertaimentMedia
        -Books
        -CDs 
        -DVD
    -Save and Load
    -EntertainmentManager
    -Filter


What are the primary responsibilities of each class?
    -program.cs - Call and initiate program with Start() method from EntertainmentManager.
    -EntertaimentMedia - Parent Class creates basic variables and methods
        -Books - book related variables and methods
        -CDs - CD related variables and methods
        -DVD - DVD related variables and methods
    -Save and Load - ask for filename, and save or load into a csv or txt file 
    -EntertainmentManager - Initializes all classes and calls them based upon the menu system created here.
    -Filter - Filter the information given by a way you wud like EX(A-Z, title)




-----------------------------------------------
Define class behaviors:
What are the behaviors this class will have in order to fulfill its responsibilities? (In other words, what things should this class do?)
    -program.cs
        -call EntertaimentMedia.Start()
    -EntertaimentMedia
        -GetDetailString() string -(abstract)
        -GetStringRepresentation() string -(abstract)
    -Books
        -GetDetailString() string -(overide)
        -GetStringRepresentation() string -(overide)
    -CDs 
        -GetDetailString() string -(overide)
        -GetStringRepresentation() string -(overide)
    -DVD

        -GetDetailString() string -(overide)
        -GetStringRepresentation() string -(overide)
    -Save and Load
        -Savetxt()
        -Loadtxt()
        -SaveCSV()
        -LoadCSV()
    -EntertainmentManager
        -Start()
        -CreateEntry()
        -ListMedia()
        -ListEntries()
    -Filter    ?   (Will need to research)
        -GetList()
        -CreateFilter()



---------------------
Define class Attributes:
What attributes does this class need to fulfill its behaviors? (In other words, what variables should this class store?)
    -program.cs
        -none
    -EntertaimentMedia
        -title
        -genre
        -rating
    -Books
        -bookList
        -author
        -illustrated
    -CDs 
        -CDList
        -Singer
    -DVD
        -DVDList
        -Directed By
    -Save and Load
        -filename
    -EntertainmentManager
        -EntertaimentMediaList
    -Filter
        -Filtertype

What are the data types of these member variables?

    -program.cs
        -none
    -EntertaimentMedia
        -title
        -genre
        -created date
    -Books
        -bookList
        -author

        -filename
    -EntertainmentManager
        -EntertaimentMediaList
    -Filter
        -Filtertype

------------------------------------------------------
Define Constructors:
What constructors should each class have? (Parameters)




What other work needs to be done to set up these objects?
