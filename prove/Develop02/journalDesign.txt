---------------------------------------------------------
Determine the classes:
- journal - stores the list of entries
- Entry/ write - shows the single entry      (- write and display- the class could create the prompts to answer and save your response and then when asked display the response you have given)
- prompt generator- creates the random prompts
- program - displays menu and cals the classes and functions as needed.

-(automatic saving) - check date time, find filename, and save entries to file. -> (double enter creates autosave) 
-(journal ext) - asking for load file to start or start a new file

-------------------------------------------------------
Define Class behaviors:
-Journal: create a list to hold all the entries, The list will need to hold date, prompt, and answer, push the entry list to a txt file.
-Entry: will call prompt generator and display it, recieve response and collect date, push this information to journal.
    -idea: it asks do you want to choose your own or be  given a prompt. (if/then statement)


-Prompt generator: get the random prompt from a chosen few.

-Generator:
    _prompts: string
