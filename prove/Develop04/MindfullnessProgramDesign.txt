What does the program do?
    -an application that holds three activities that can help with mindfulness, The activities include Breathing excersises, reflection activity, and listing activities.
-------------------------------------
What user inputs does it have?
    -options menu
    - duration in which the activity will go on for. 
    -(listing activity) - typing items they think about
----------------------------------------
What output does it produce?
    - menu options
    - Name of activity
    - description of activity
    - (breathing)prompts for breathing in and out.
    - (reflection) prompt for a general moment and then follow up questions
    - (listing) prompt for a general moment and total of user input.
    - end the program with well done
--------------------------------------------
How does the program end?
    - choose the quit menu options
    - and each activity says well done
----------------------------------------
Determine Classes:

What are good candidates for classes in this program?
    - activities
    - breathing activity
    - Reflection activity
    - listing activity
    - program 
What are the primary responsibilities of each class?
    - (Base) activities( this will hold the welcome message, description variable, how long activity will last, end prompt with welldone)
    - breathing activity(holds description, breathe in and out)
    - Reflection activity(prompt telling what too think about, hit enter to move on, and asks a question every few seconds until duration ends)
    - listing activity(list items based on a prompt, count the amount of items you have typed)
    - program(menu compiler and caller of other classes based on chosen items)
---------------------------------------
Example:
Activity
    DisplayStartingMessage() : void
    DisplayEndingMessage() : void
    ShowSpinner(seconds : int) : void
    ShowCountDown(second : int) : void
BreathingActivity
    Run() : void
ListingActivity
    Run() : void
    GetRandomPrompt() : string
    GetListFromUser() : List<string>
ReflectingActivity
    Run() : void
    GetRandomPrompt() : string
    GetRandomQuestion() : string
    DisplayPrompt() : void
    DisplayQuestions() : void
------------------------------------------
Determine Class Attributes:
What attributes does this class need to fulfill its behaviors? (In other words, what variables should this class store?)
What are the data types of these member variables?

Activity
    _name : string
    _description : string
    _duration : int
BreathingActivity
    None needed
ListingActivity
    _count : int
    _prompts : List<string>
ReflectingActivity
    _prompts : List<string>
    _questions : List<string>
-----------------------------------------------
Define Constructors:
What constructors should each class have?
Activity
    - pass in (string name, string description, int duration)

BreathingActivity
    - gives the (string name, string description) passes in duration

ReflectingActivity
    - gives the (string name, string description) passes in duration

ListingActivity
    - Gives the  (string name, string description) passes in duration
